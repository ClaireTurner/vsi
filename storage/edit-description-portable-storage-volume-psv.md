# Editing a portable storage description

You can view portable storage volumes (PSVs) in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}. The portable storage page displays the PSV's description, location, capacity and device name to which the PSV is associated. You can update the description at any time. Update each PSV description to a unique identifier related to the use of the PSV.

## Editing a PSV description

1. Access **Portable Storage** in the  [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window}. For more information, see [Accessing portable storage](/docs/vsi/storage/access-portable-storage-screen.html){:new_window}.
* Locate the portable storage volumes that you want.<br/>**Note:** Use the **Filter** tool quickly locate a volume in a long list.
* Click the **Description** section for the PSV to open the description for edits.
* Enter or revise the content in the **Description** field, as necessary.
* Click anywhere in the row containing the PSV to save the edited description.

## Next Steps

After editing the description for a PSV, it will remain in its original location in the list until you exit the portable storage page. When you reopen the page, the PSV appears in a new location, based on the description's alphabetical order. If the PSV cannot be located in this list after relaunching the screen, hold **CTRL** and click the **Refresh** button to clear the browser's cache and try again. The description can be changed again at any time by repeating the steps above.
