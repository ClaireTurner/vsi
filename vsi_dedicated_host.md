# Dedicated hosts and dedicated instances 

Dedicated hosts are virtual servers that allow you to specify in which data center and POD you want the host placed. You then assign instances, or virtual machines, to a specific host for maximum control over workload placement and flexible cost-provisioning options.

## Guaranteed capacity
You're guaranteed capacity within the data center and POD in which your host is placed. For example, if the POD containing your dedicated host and dedicated instances reaches capacity, you can continue to assign dedicated instances to your host if your host has appropriate space.

## Visible workloads
You can view overall resource consumption for all dedicated instances assigned to a dedicated host on one page. View core, RAM, and local storage usage, which helps you determine if you need to migrate dedicated instances to another dedicated host. This level of granularity gives you the ability to manage your workloads with maximum control. 

## Post-deployment management
In addition to guaranteed capacity and visibility to your workloads, you can migrate your dedicated instances between dedicated hosts for maximum control over workload placement.
