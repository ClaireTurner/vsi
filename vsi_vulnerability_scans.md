# Running a vulnerability scan
{: #virtual-server-v-scans}

You can run a vulnerability scan for any of your servers. A vulnerability scan attempts to find potential security problems on a server by first searching for open ports and the services that run on them. If any services are found, the scanner checks for version and patch information of each service found. The scanner also uses the information that is gathered to search its database of known vulnerabilities and generate a report. Reports typically take five to ten minutes to run but allow for up to thirty minutes in rare cases.

A vulnerability report typically includes the following information:
* Number of security holes and warnings.
* The hosts that were scanned.
* The port or service and the corresponding issue.
* Detailed information about the issue, risk factor, and possible fixes.

If you have a firewall, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} administrative networks need permissions for an effective vulnerability scan. If a firewall is blocking all ports, the report might not show any problems even if some exist. In addition, you might have some indication in your firewall logs of a scan that is taking place as ports on your system are investigated.
