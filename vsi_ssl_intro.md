# SSL certificates
{: #ssl-certificates}

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a technology that encrypts traffic between the client application and the server application involved in the conversation. This encryption is accomplished through a public key/private key system using an SSL certificate.
{:shortdesc}

The SSL certificate contains the serverâ€™s public key, dates for which the certificate is valid, a host name for which the certificate is valid and a signature from the Certification Authority which issued it. With this information and some protocol information exchanged during the beginning of a session, the client can be reasonably certain that the server is the one to which it is intending to talk.

For more information about SSL certificates, see [Getting started with SSL certificates](/docs/infrastructure/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-getting-started-tutorial).
