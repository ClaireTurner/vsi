# Getting started with virtual servers
You can deploy {{site.data.keyword.BluVirtServers}} in a matter of minutes. The virtual servers are deployed from your choice of virtual server images and in the geographic region that makes sense for your workloads.
{:shortdesc}

When you create a virtual server, you can choose between hourly or monthly billing. You can also choose between a public (multi-tenancy) environment or a dedicated (single-tenancy) environment. Then, you can choose either high-performance local disks or enterprise SAN storage for your virtual server.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, review the following prerequisites.

  1. You must have an upgraded account to order virtual servers. This process can take some time and requires your request to be approved before you can continue. For more information about upgrading your account, see [Switching to IBMid](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/admin/softlayerlink.html).
  2. Review and choose your deployment options. For more information, see the following topics:

## Provisioning a virtual server 

After you decide upon a deployment option, begin the provisioning process.

## Next Steps

After your virtual server is provisioned and available to use, you can configure your virtual servers by using the 
{{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}} or {{site.data.keyword.slapi_full}}. For more information, see [Configuring virtual servers](../vsi/vsi_configuring.html).
