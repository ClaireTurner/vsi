# About suspend billing (Beta)
{: #requirements}

When you power off a virtual server that supports the suspend billing feature, you do not accrue costs for certain compute resources. Billing stops automatically when the server is powered off. The suspend billing feature helps you reduce cost and prevents you from having to reprovision a virtual server when you need its resources again. Suspend billing is only supported on new provisions, not existing instances.
{:shortdesc}

This feature is available in data centers across the globe. To have access to the suspend billing feature, you must provision the new virtual server instance by using the {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} to specify the suspend billing package. The new virtual server instance must be configured with the following settings:

* Hourly SAN
* Public flavors of one of the following families:
  * Balanced
  * Compute
  * Memory

You can use the suspend billing feature as a faster alternative to provisioning and de-provisioning a virtual server instance.
{:tip}

**Note:** Billing is suspended only when you power off your virtual server instance through the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}, CLI, or {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}}. If you power off your virtual server instance directly through the OS, billing isn't suspended for that instance.

## Provisioning

For the beta, to provision a virtual server instance that supports the suspend billing feature, you must use the {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}}. For API examples, see [Provisioning a public instance using Place Order Object](../vsi/vsi_provision_api.html#provisioning-a-public-instance-using-place-order-object). 

You also must specify the specific suspend billing package ID during the provisioning process. You can query in the {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} for the suspend billing package ID by using the keyName `SUSPEND_CLOUD_SERVER`. For an example on searching for server packages, see [Understanding and building an order using the {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} order CLI ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://softlayer.github.io/article/understanding-ordering/){: new_window}.

## Billing details

It's important to understand what costs stop accruing and what costs persist when your virtual server instance is powered off.

| Resource                      | Billing stopped   | Billing persists |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| vCPU                          |          X        |                  |
| RAM                           |          X        |                  |
| Port speed                    |          X        |                  |
| Operating system licenses     |          X        |                  |
| Monitoring add-ons Â           |          X        |                  |
| Secondary public IP addresses |                   |         X        |
| Storage                       |                   |         X        |

**Note:** When you provision a virtual server instance that supports the suspend billing feature, the usage times are calculated per minute, for both the in use time and suspended time of your virtual server instance. Even if you never initiate the suspend billing feature by powering off your instance, the billing is calculated per minute of the instance's lifecyle. 

### Minimum usage charge
Virtual server instances that support the suspend billing feature have a minimum usage charge per month. If usage is greater than 25%, you are billed for that usage. If usage is less than 25%, you are charged for 25% of the hours that the instance existed within the current billing cycle. 

### Billing invoice
When you suspend billing on a virtual server, you will see a few changes in your billing invoice. The relevant charges now appear as usage-based details. For example, you might see the following additions that reflect hours available, hours used, and total number of hours charged:

```
Computing instance usage...
RAM usage...
Operating system usage...
```

## Resource details

### Storage

When you suspend billing on a virtual server instance, the associated storage persists, but you cannot access data while the virtual server instance is powered off. When you resume billing on the instance, you can then access your data and normal billing begins again.

### IP addresses

All public IP addresses are retained for you when billing is suspended for your virtual server instance.

You can view whether your device is stopped, as well as the relevant date when the status changed, through the {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} or by accessing the Device details page in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}.

### Limitations

The number of supported, concurrent instances are part of your account-wide device quota. For more information about concurrent instance limits, see [FAQ: Virtual servers](vsi_faqs_vs.html#concurrent).

## Next steps
After you provision a virtual server that supports suspend billing, you can begin to suspend and resume billing on the device.
When billing is suspended on a virtual server instance, you cannot complete all of the same actions on the instance until you resume billing for the device.

To suspend billing on a virtual server instance, power off the virtual server. For more information, see [Managing virtual servers](vsi_managing.html).
