# Reserved virtual servers
{: #about-reserved-virtual-servers}

{{site.data.keyword.BluVirtServers}} reserved instances offering is a great option if you want guaranteed resources for future deployments and cost savings. You choose between either a one or three year contract term for your reserved capacity. Within that reserved capacity, you can reserve a set of up to 20 virtual server instances of a specific size and provision those instances when you need them. You are guaranteed this capacity within the POD and data center of your choice for the life of the contract term.

Reserved virtual server instances offer many advantages, including the following:

* **Guaranteed capacity**

    When you reserve capacity, this capacity is guaranteed for the life of your contract term.

* **Global availability**

    The reserved virtual server offering is available in data centers across the globe.

* **Reliable provisioning**

   You can provision and reclaim virtual server instances to your reserved capacities at any time.

* **Cost savings**

    Choosing either a one or three year contract term allows for consistent monthly payments and reduced costs compared to hourly or monthly virtual server billing cycles.

## Limitations

Consider the following limitations before reserving capacity and provisioning reserved virtual server instances:

  * Reserved virtual server instances can only use SAN-backed storage (balanced, memory, compute).
  * You can't upgrade or downgrade your instances.
  * Reserved capacity cannot be canceled; however, you can reclaim virtual server instances in that capacity.

## Notifications

You will receive an email notification one month before the end of the term on your reserved virtual server capacity.
