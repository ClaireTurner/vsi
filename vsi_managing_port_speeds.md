# Managing port speeds

The {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}} allows you to modify the speed that your server is negotiating at, without opening a support ticket.

Complete the following steps to update port speeds.

1. Access the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} by using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Devices > Device Lists.**
3. Select the server that you want to update.
4. In the **Configuration** tab, go to **Network.**
5. Select the drop-down menu in **Speed** (for either public or private network) to update port speed.

A manual configuration change for your server's network settings is required to complete the port speed change.
