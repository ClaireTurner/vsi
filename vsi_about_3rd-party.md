# 3rd party images
{: #about-3rd-party}

Some third party vendors provide images that include specific VSI parameters and software. You can provision a VSI by selection one of these 3rd party images. All requirements, configurations and software are built into the image.


## Next steps

To provision a VSI using a 3rd party image, see [Provisioning a virtual server instance from a 3rd party image](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-ordering-3P#ordering-3P).
