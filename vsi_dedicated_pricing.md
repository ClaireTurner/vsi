# Dedicated virtual server pricing
Pricing for dedicated hosts will be offered in an hourly and monthly model.
{:shortdesc}

Dedicated host pricing can be seen below and will be inclusive of all vCPU, RAM, local storage and uplink port speed components as instances are provisioned onto dedicated hosts. 

With dedicated hosts, additional local storage discs will be available, on first, second, third, fourth, and fifth discs. There is also additional capacity up to 400GB on each secondary disc.

Hourly instances can be provisioned on hourly and monthly hosts. Monthly instances can only be provisioned on monthly hosts.

| Host configuration | vCPU	| RAM (GB) | Local storage (TB SSD) |	Hourly price | Monthly price | 
| ------------------ | ---- | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 56x242x1.2TB	     |  56 	|   242    |        	1.2	          |     $3.164   | 	$2,099.95   |

SAN (network attached), premium OSs, and SW Add-ons will be charged hourly or monthly, by the instance, depending on the instance provisioned on the dedicated host. Pricing for these components is consistent with the existing offering on public instances and dedicated instances. 

For example, a dedicated instance provisioned on a dedicated host with the following configuration will not be charged by the instance. vCPU, RAM, local storage and uplink port speeds are included in dedicated host charges. 

* 8 vCPU
* 16 GB RAM
* 100 GB Local SSD first disc
* 400 GB Local SSD second disc
* 400 GB Local SSD third disc
* 1  Gbps public and prive network uplinks (dedicated host)
