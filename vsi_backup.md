# Back-up services

## EVault backup

EVault Backup is an automated agent-based backup system that is managed through the EVault WebCC browser-based management utility, providing users with a method to back up data between servers in one or more data centers on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} network.  Administrators can set backups to follow an hourly, daily, weekly, or custom schedule that targets full systems, specific directories, or even individual files.  Additional plug-ins allow for compatibility with software like Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SQL, as well as other types of third-party software and enables users to perform a Bare Metal Restore, when necessary.

For more information about eVault back-up services, see [Getting Started with Backup Services](../infrastructure/Backup/index.html){: new_window}.

## R1Soft CDP

Continuous Data Protection (CDP) is a high-performance backup software created by R1Soft that allows for backup of both physical and virtual devices. Idera CDP consists of three main components: the CDP server, the agent, and the database plugins, which are available for purchase separately from the first two components.  Because R1Soft CDP is a third-party backup solution, interactions with CDP take place entirely outside of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} proprietary interfaces; however, R1Soft CDP passwords may be tracked and stored within {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}.  All other interactions with R1Soft CDP are documented on the R1Soft website.
