## View portable storage for a virtual server  
 Portable storage is a secondary storage disk that can be detached from one virtual server and attached to another. 
 A portable storage disk can be connected to one virtual server at a time and retains all information 
 that is stored on it for easy transfer between devices. Portable storage can be purchased and applied 
 to your virtual server at any time.

To view portable storage, complete the following steps:

1. From the Device List, click the *Virtual Server name* that contains the desired portable storage device.
2. Click the **Configuration** tab.
3. Click the **View Portable Storage for this Device** button. Portable storage will be displayed for the device.

## Can I add disk storage to my hourly or monthly virtual server?
You can upgrade or downgrade disk storage for any virtual server by updating your storage options in the *First Disk* through 
*Fifth Disk* fields in the Configuration screen of the device that you want to update. For more information, see [Reconfiguring an existing virtual server](../vsi/vsi_reconfigure.html).
