# Downgrading port speeds

You can temporarily downgrade port speeds without opening a ticket. You can access the **Port Controls** option be clicking **Actions** in the upper-right from the **Device Details** page. From this screen, select the speed you need, or disconnect it.
{:shortdesc}

You can only downgrade, disconnect, or reconnect at a maximum of whatever you are already paying for. You cannot upgrade from this option. The changes stay in the portal until you change it back. No billing changes are made from this, and downgrading your server temporarily does not lower your bill. If you need a permanent change to your port speed, you must open a sales ticket.

When changing port speeds or disconnecting your ports for any reason, you must manually change the server itself.
