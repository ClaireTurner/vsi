# Viewing portable storage  
{: #view-portable-storage}

 Portable storage is a secondary storage disk that can be detached from one virtual server and attached to another. 
 A portable storage disk can be connected to one virtual server at a time and retains all information 
 that is stored on it for easy transfer between devices. Portable storage can be purchased and applied 
 to your virtual server at any time.
