# Managing virtual servers
{: #managing-virtual-servers}

From the Device List, you can manage virtual servers and other devices such as bare metal servers and VLAN firewalls.
{:shortdesc}

In the device list, virtual servers have a device type of *Virtual*. Bare metal servers are indicated with the device type of *Server*. Dedicated hosts have a device type of *Dedicated Virtual Host*. Many interactions available for the devices are similar, but each type of device also has device-specific interactions.

The following virtual server management tasks are available to you from the device list:
* Reboot -  immediately power off a device and then power it back on again.
* Power On / Off - remotely turn a device on or off.
* Rename - change or update a device name.
* Cancel - end use of a device. Devices can be canceled immediately or on a billing anniversary. Refunds cannot be given for immediate cancellations.

Complete the following steps to perform management tasks for your virtual servers from the Device List in the Customer Portal:  
1. Log in to the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} by using your unique credentials. 
2. From the **Devices** menu, select **Device List**.
3. Click **Actions** for the device you want to manage and select the wanted management task.

**Tips:** 
* You can interact with servers in the Customer Portal in both the Snapshot view (a summary of your device) and on the Device Details screen (a fully detailed list). To view and interact with your server in the Snapshot View, click the arrow next to the Device Name to expand the view. To view and interact with your server on the Device Details screen, click the Device Name of the server.
* You can add notes to a device at any time from the **Configuration** tab. nNtes can help idenitfy details about the device, its use, and actions that have been taken on the device.

## What happens next

* **Rename**

After renaming the device, the name will automatically be updated in the Customer Portal. When performing a search within the Portal, use the new device name when attempting to locate content associated with it. Repeat the previous steps to rename the device again at any time.

## Next Steps
If you need to reconfigure an existing virtual server, see [Reconfiguring an existing virtual server](../vsi/vsi_reconfigure.html).
