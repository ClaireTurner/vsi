# Back-up services

## EVault backup

EVault Backup is an automated agent-based backup system that is managed through the EVault WebCC browser-based management utility, providing users with a method to back up data between servers in one or more data centers on the SoftLayer Network.  Administrators can set backups to follow an hourly, daily, weekly, or custom schedule that targets full systems, specific directories, or even individual files.  Additional plug-ins allow for compatibility with software like Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SQL, as well as other types of third-party software and enables users to perform a Bare Metal Restore, when necessary.

## R1Soft CDP

Continuous Data Protection (CDP) is a high-performance backup software created by R1Soft that allows for backup of both physical and virtual devices. Idera CDP consists of three main components: the CDP server, the agent and the database plugins, which are available for purchase separately from the first two components.  Because R1Soft CDP is a third-party backup solution, interactions with CDP take place entirely outside of Bluemix proprietary interfaces; however, R1Soft CDP passwords may be tracked and stored within [Bluemix Customer Portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window}.  All other interactions with R1Soft CDP are documented on the R1Soft website.
