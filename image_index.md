# Working with image templates
You can access the Image Templates screen in the Customer Portal.
{:shortdesc}

Use the following steps to access the Image Templates screen in the Customer Portal.

* Log in to the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com){: new_window} by using your unique credentials.
* From the **Devices** menu, select **Images**.

On the *Image Templates* screen, you see all of the private images that are associated with the account. Any interactions with private images  happen here, and from this page you can drag columns to customize the view and access public images. The Image Templates screens are the central storage locations for both Flex and Standard Images. Interactions with both types of images are identical, except for the types of servers that you can order.

For more information about image templates, see [Image templates ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/image-templates){: new_window} in KnowledgeLayer.
